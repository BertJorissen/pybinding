    "# Multi-orbital models\n",
    "\n",
    "In pybinding, if an onsite or hopping energy term is defined as a matrix (instead of a scalar), we refer to the resulting model as multi-orbital. The elements of the matrix term may correspond to different spins, electrons and holes, or any other degrees of freedom. These can have different physical meaning depending on the intend of the model. Because we’re talking in generic terms here, we’ll use orbital as a blanket term to refer to any degree of freedom, i.e. matrix element of an onsite or hopping term.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how these models can be defined and how the presence of multiple orbitals affects modifier functions and the results obtained from solvers. In general, it is as simple as replacing a scalar value with a matrix while all of the principals described in the [Tutorial](http://docs.pybinding.site/page/advanced/../tutorial/index.html) still apply.\n",
