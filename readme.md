PyBinding (Python tight-binding) is a library for numerical tight-binding calculation in solid-state physics.

Status: **Alpha** - work in progress.

The core of the library is written in modern C++11 for performance. By default, it is compiled as a Python extension module for easy scripting, but it may also be used directly as a C++ library.
