Lattice
-------

A :class:`.Lattice` object describes the unit cell of a crystal lattice. This includes the
primitive vectors, positions of sublattice sites and hopping parameters which connect those sites.
All of this structural information is used to build-up a larger system by translation.


Example
*******

The following code shows the basic steps for creating and inspecting a lattice. The text below
will explain things in more detail, this is just a quick preview. Full example file:

Square lattice
**************

Starting from the basics, we'll create a simple square lattice.

.. plot::
    :context: reset
    :nofigs:

    d = 0.2  # [nm] unit cell length
    t = 1    # [eV] hopping energy

    # create a simple 2D lattice with vectors a1 and a2
    lattice = pb.Lattice(a1=[d, 0], a2=[0, d])

    lattice.add_sublattices(
        ('A', [0, 0])  # add an atom called 'A' at position [0, 0]
    )

    lattice.add_hoppings(
        # (relative_index, from_sublattice, to_sublattice, energy)
        ([0, 1], 'A', 'A', t),
        ([1, 0], 'A', 'A', t)
    )


This code may not be immediately obvious. Fortunately, :class:`.Lattice` objects have a convenient
:meth:`.Lattice.plot()` method to easily visualize the constructed lattice.

.. plot::
    :context:

    lattice.plot()  # plot the lattice that was just constructed
    plt.show()      # standard matplotlib show() function

In the figure we see lattice vectors :math:`a_1` and :math:`a_2` which were used to initialize
:class:`.Lattice`. The blue circle labeled 'A' represents the atom which was created with the
:meth:`.Lattice.add_sublattices()` method. The slightly faded out circles represent translations
of the lattice in the primitive vector directions.

The hoppings are specified using the :meth:`.Lattice.add_hoppings()` method and each one consists of
`(relative_index, from_sublattice, to_sublattice, energy)`:

* The main cell always has the index [0, 0]. The `relative_index` represents the number of steps
  needed to reach another cell starting from the main one. Each cell is labeled with their
  `relative_index`, as seen in the figure.

* A hopping is created between the main cell and a neighboring cell specified by `relative_index`.
  Two hoppings are added in the definition: [0, 1] and [1, 0]. The opposite hoppings [0, -1] and
  [-1, 0] are added automatically to maintain hermiticity.

* This lattice consists of only one sublattice so the `from` and `to` sublattice fields
  are trivial. Generally, `from_sublattice` indicates the sublattice in the [0, 0] cell
  and `to_sublattice` in the neighboring cell. This will be explained further in the next example.

* The last parameter is simply the value of the hopping energy.

It's good practice to build the lattice inside a function to make it easily reusable.
Here we define the same lattice as before, but note that the unit cell length and hopping energy
are function arguments, which makes the lattice easily configurable.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    def square_lattice(d, t):
        lat = pb.Lattice(a1=[d, 0], a2=[0, d])

        lat.add_sublattices(
            ('A', [0, 0])
        )

        lat.add_hoppings(
            ([0, 1], 'A', 'A', t),
            ([1, 0], 'A', 'A', t),
        )

        return lat

    lattice = square_lattice(d=0.1, t=1)
    lattice.plot()
    plt.show()


Graphene
********

The next example shows a slightly more complicate two-atom lattice of graphene.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    from math import sqrt

    def monolayer_graphene():
        a = 0.24595   # [nm] unit cell length
        a_cc = 0.142  # [nm] carbon-carbon distance
        t = -2.8      # [eV] nearest neighbour hopping

        lat = pb.Lattice(
            a1=[a, 0],
            a2=[a/2, a/2 * sqrt(3)]
        )

        lat.add_sublattices(
            ('A', [0, -a_cc/2]),
            ('B', [0,  a_cc/2])
        )

        lat.add_hoppings(
            # inside the main cell
            ([0,  0], 'A', 'B', t),
            # between neighboring cells
            ([1, -1], 'A', 'B', t),
            ([0, -1], 'A', 'B', t)
        )

        return lat

    lattice = monolayer_graphene()
    lattice.plot()
    plt.show()

The :meth:`.Lattice.add_sublattices()` method creates atoms A and B (blue and orange) at
different offsets: :math:`[0, -a_{cc}/2]` and :math:`[0, a_{cc}/2]`.
The hoppings are defined as follows:

* `([0,  0], 'A', 'B', t)` specifies the hopping inside the main cell, from atom A to B. The main
  [0,0] cell is never labeled in the figure, but it is always the central cell where the lattice
  vectors originate.
* `([1, -1], 'A', 'B', t)` specifies the hopping between [0, 0] and [1, -1], from A to B. The
  opposite hopping is added automatically: [-1, 1], from B to A. In the tight-binding matrix
  representation, the opposite hopping is the Hermitian conjugate of the first one. The lattice
  specification always requires explicitly mentioning just one half of the hoppings while the
  other half is automatically added to guarantee hermiticity.
* `([0, -1], 'A', 'B', t)` is handled in the very same way.

The :meth:`.Lattice.plot()` method will always faithfully draw any lattice that has been specified.
It serves as a handy visual inspection tool.


Brillouin zone
**************

The method :meth:`.Lattice.plot_brillouin_zone()` is another handy tool that does just as it's
name implies.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    lattice = monolayer_graphene()
    lattice.plot_brillouin_zone()

The reciprocal lattice vectors :math:`b_1` and :math:`b_2` are calculated automatically based
on the real space vectors. There is no need to specify them manually. The first Brillouin zone
is determined as the Wignerâ€“Seitz cell in reciprocal space. By default, the plot method labels
the vertices of the Brillouin zone.
